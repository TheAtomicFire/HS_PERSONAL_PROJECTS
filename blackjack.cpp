NOTE: IF DOESNT WORK REPLACE BLACKJACK NAME WITH MAIN()

BLACKJACK program by Danny Vicario
2018-2019

I use the srand function for finding random numbers as card
chrono::seconds dura( 1); AND
 this_thread::sleep_for( dura ); are used to let console wait a second to pace it out a bit
 "Conversionf rom time_T to unsigned int" warning does not cause any problems in program as it only runs for 1 second
 //A select few comments might be legacy from an earlier version of the program where the variables were all different. Don't mind these

Posssible Changes:
Hearts/Clubs/Diamonds/Spades not incorporated
Kings/Queens/Jacks not incorporated
Maybe clean up code

Bugs:
None

Okay, here's how the oppRandom function works. This will also explain how the opponent determines if they should hit or hold. 
(Shown in the if statements below) The opponent always draws two cards, which add up to a single value. The opponent has a possibility of 
hitting 3 more times. If the card values together are less than 11, then the opponent will hit no matter what. But if it's more than 11,
then should they hit? Well, the computer isn't human so the best thing we can do is use RNG. But obviously an opponent is more likely to
hit if they have 13 points than if they had 20 points. Basically, various random values are generated (ran, ran2, ran3, etc.). Three chance values
are generated, each for two_values, three_values, and four_values. (Note: card values and summary variables are made regardless of if the
opponent actually decides to hit.) So, for each chance value, the sum variables are put into this function. If the sum is a certain number, 
the chance value will be returned
EXAMPLE: --
two_values (card1 + card2) = 14
ran (RNG for two_values) = 73
oppRandom(14) = 40
73 > 40
Opponent hits. Gets a card3 value of 6, thus having a sum of 20
ran2(RNG for three_values): 47
oppRandom(20) = 95
47 !> 95
Opponent is done. Has a value of 20.

NOTE: chance values might need slight tweaking
